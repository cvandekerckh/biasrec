            <p>
                You are once again benefiting from the same workplace lunch offer. As before, your employer
                covers the cost of your meals, which you will eat during your lunch breaks at work.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Please complete the shopping task again as you did previously.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>You will be asked to:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Select <strong>two ready-to-eat prepared meals</strong>, one for each of the next two Mondays;</li>
                <li>Add these meals to your shopping cart;</li>
                <li>Confirm your shopping cart as if you were completing a real purchase.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                Please make your choices <strong>as realistically as possible</strong>, as if you were
                genuinely selecting meals for yourself.
